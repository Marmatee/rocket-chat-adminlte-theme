# rocket-chat-adminlte-theme
Theme inspired by the colour scheme of AdminLTE

### Instructions
- Navigate to Administration | Layout | Custom CSS Expand
- Paste CSS into this section
- SAVE CHANGES

### Google Fonts
I'm using Source Sans Pro for this CSS so you will need to reference it in the HTML for it to display. Easy stuff, do it like this:

- Navigate to Administration | Layout | Content Expand
- In the "Home Body" section, under the default text or whatever you've entered in here, paste the following:

```
<link href='https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Source+Sans+Pro' rel='stylesheet' type='text/css'>
```

- SAVE CHANGES
